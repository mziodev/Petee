# Project Notes

## Vaccine model
Each pet species need a separate vaccine model. This is because vaccine types: canine and feline types are different so models need to be different too. It seems to be the simplest way to do it. 

## Pet icon color
Maybe we can try to color dog and cat icons differently no the main pet list.
