# Project Notes
 
## Pet chip ID
We need to implement a separate structure for this piece of data:
* Chip ID number
* Implanted Date
* Location (inside the animal)

We can implement a link to [PETMAXX](https://www.petmaxx.com) directly from Chip ID number.

## Vaccine model
Each pet species need a separate vaccine model. This is because vaccine types: canine and feline types are different so models need to be different too. It seems to be the simplest way to do it. 

## Pet icon color
Maybe we can try to color dog and cat icons differently no the main pet list.
