# Project Notes

## Vaccine model
Each pet species need a separate vaccine model. This is because vaccine types: canine and feline types are different so models need to be different too. It seems to be the simplest way to do it. 

## Pet icon color
Maybe we can try to color dog and cat icons differently no the main pet list.


## Chip ID Types
There are three main formats for pet microchip IDs:
* 9-digit code: This is an older format, typically used by AVID (American Veterinary Identification Devices) microchips. The 9-digit code is numeric only and doesn't include a checksum.
* 10-digit code: This is the most widely used format, compliant with the ISO 11784 standard. It's a 10-digit alphanumeric code, with the first three digits representing the country code or manufacturer code, followed by a unique identifier, and ending with a two-digit checksum.
* 15-digit code: This is a newer format, used by some microchip manufacturers, such as ISO-compliant microchips from companies like Datamars or Trovan. The 15-digit code is also alphanumeric and includes a longer unique identifier and a checksum.
